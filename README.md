# æneria - A little dashboard to analyse your electricity consumption data from Linky

The idea of æneria is to display electricity consumption and weather data on a little dashboard that allow the user to:

* Better understand his electricity consumption,
* Analyse his electricity consumption throw weather data (in a first time, essentialy temperature).
*

**For more informations, see [æneria's documentation on Read the Docs](https://docs.aeneria.com/)**
(sorry it's in french cause this project is based on Linky and Enedis, main users will be french)

## Disclaimer

**This app is not a tentative to prove that Linky is cool.**
I'm not a big fan of Linky and you can understand why on [Reporterre.net [fr]](https://reporterre.net/Linky-n-est-pas-un-ami-la-grande-enquete-de-Reporterre)

But, now we have this little sneaky guy in our home, well, let's use it.

And I can say that dispite what Enedis says: `Linky is great opportunity for users to understand their consumption and reduce it blablabla..`

They do nothing to help individuals to use their data in their own (and not just visualize it on their website or on their partner's one).
There's no API (or maybe there's one but any documentation can't be found) to programmaticly get our own data.

I want to thanks [KibOost](https://github.com/KiboOst/) for [the retroengineering he has done](https://github.com/KiboOst/php-LinkyAPI).
